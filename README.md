## Understanding Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens

This topic explains the concepts of Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens in a clear and concise way. It is a handy guide for developers looking to implement secure authentication mechanisms in their applications.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **What is an Access Token?**
- A short-lived token used to access protected resources.
- Typically included in the Authorization header of API requests.
- Ensures that the user is authenticated for the requested resource.

### 2. **What is a Refresh Token?**
- A long-lived token used to obtain a new Access Token when the current one expires.
- Helps maintain a secure and seamless user experience.
- Stored securely (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies) to prevent unauthorized access.

### 3. **Why Use Both Tokens?**
- Access Tokens expire quickly for security purposes.
- Refresh Tokens allow re-authentication without requiring user login repeatedly.

### 4. **Token Lifecycle**
- Issuance: Both tokens are issued during authentication.
- Usage: Access Tokens are used for accessing resources; Refresh Tokens are used for getting new Access Tokens.
- Expiry and Rotation: Refresh Tokens can be rotated or invalidated for enhanced security.

### 5. **How to Implement Access and Refresh Tokens?**
- Steps to integrate with popular frameworks (Node.js, Express, etc.).
- Secure storage and transmission best practices.
- Error handling for expired or invalid tokens.

### 6. **Common Security Practices**
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Store Refresh Tokens securely (avoid local storage for sensitive data).
- Implement token expiration and rotation strategies.
- Avoid token leakage by adhering to best practices in client-server communication.
